My current research interest is in the effects of genetics, training, and nutrition on endurance performance and the epigenetic regulation of physiological adaptations to endurance training implicated in performance and health. My recent studies include investigations of 1) the effect of the ACTN3 gene on running performance in recreationally active men and women, 2) the effect of ketogenic and high-carbohydrate diets on cycling performance and circulating microRNA, 3) caffeine supplementation strategies among endurance athletes, and 4) training characteristics in recreationally competitive cyclists and triathletes and their effects on endurance performance using raw crowdsourced training session data. 

I plan to extend this research by incorporating findings from molecular research (microRNA response to a variety of exercise and nutrition interventions) in the design of applied training studies to investigate the long-term effects and mechanisms of different microRNA expression profiles on exercise performance and health.
