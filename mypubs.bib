	abstract = {Endurance athletes may implement rigid dietary strategies, such as the ketogenic diet (KD), to improve performance. The effect of the KD on appetite remains unclear in endurance athletes. This study analyzed the effects of a KD, a high-carbohydrate diet (HCD), and habitual diet (HD) on objective and subjective measures of appetite in trained cyclists and triathletes, and hypothesized that the KD would result in greater objective and subjective appetite suppression. Six participants consumed the KD and HCD for two-weeks each, in a random order, following their HD. Fasting appetite measures were collected after two-weeks on each diet. Postprandial appetite measures were collected following consumption of a ketogenic meal after the KD, high-carbohydrate meal after the HCD, and standard American/Western meal after the HD. Fasting total ghrelin (GHR) was lower and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and hunger were higher following the KD versus HD and HCD. Fasting insulin was not different. Mixed-effects model repeated measures analysis and effect sizes and 95\% confidence intervals showed that postprandial GHR and insulin were lower and GLP-1 was higher following the ketogenic versus the standard and high-carbohydrate meals. Postprandial appetite ratings were not different across test meals. In conclusion, both fasting and postprandial concentrations of GHR were lower and GLP-1 were higher following the KD than the HC and HD, and postprandial insulin was lower on the KD. Subjective ratings of appetite did not correspond with the objective measures of appetite in trained competitive endurance athlete. More research is needed to confirm our findings.},

	abstract = {High-sugar consumption is related to dyslipidemia. How acute exercise affects postprandial lipid and lipoprotein particle responses to a high-sugar meal (HSM) in postmenopausal women is unclear. We examined the effects of a late afternoon/early evening bout of aerobic exercise on postprandial lipid and lipoprotein particle responses to a HSM breakfast the following day in 22 postmenopausal women. Subjects underwent exercise (EX) and no exercise (NE) conditions in the evening 13–16 h before the HSM breakfast consumption, in a random order. During the EX condition, subjects performed supervised aerobic exercise for 60 min at 75\% of age-predicted maximum heart rate. The HSM (75.6\% carbohydrate and 33\% energy needs) was consumed after a 12-h fast. Serum lipids and lipoproteins were assessed at baseline and postprandially (60, 120, 180 min). Repeated measures analysis showed significantly lower area under the curve (geometric means [95\% CI]) for triglycerides (TG) (2.96[2.43, 3.61] vs. 3.24[2.70, 3.88] mmol/L*hr; p = 0.049) and very low density lipoprotein particles (VLDLP) (114.6[88.2, 148.9] vs. 134.3[108.1, 166.9] nmol/L*hr; p = 0.02) during the EX versus NE condition. There were no condition effects for other variables. In conclusion, the EX versus NE condition lowered postprandial AUC for TG and VLDLP following HSM consumption in postmenopausal women.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02919488},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine whether session rating of perceived exertion-derived training load (sRPE-TL) correlates with GPS-derived measures of external load in National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) Division I female soccer athletes. Methods: Twenty-one NCAA Division 1 collegiate women’s soccer athletes (11 starters, 10 non-starters; 65.1 ± 7.2 kg, 168.4 ± 7.9 cm, 20.3 ± 1.5 yrs) volunteered to take part in this study. Data for this study were collected over the course of 16 weeks during the 2018 NCAA women’s soccer season. External load and heart rate (HR) data were collected during each training session and match during the season. At least 30 min after the end of an activity (e.g., match or practice), athletes were prompted to complete a questionnaire reporting their perceived exertion for the session. sRPE-TL was calculated at the end of the season by multiplying perceived exertion by the respective session duration. Results: sRPE-TL was very strongly correlated with total distance, distance covered in velocity zones 1–3, the number of accelerations in zones 4 and 5, total PlayerLoad™, and PlayerLoad™. For internal load, sRPE-TL correlated very strongly (0.70 ≤ {\textbar}r{\textbar} \&lt; 0.90) with Edward’s and Bannister’s TRIMP and strongly (0.50 ≤ {\textbar}r{\textbar} \&lt; 0.70) with duration spent in in heart rate zones 5 and 6 (80–90\% and 90–100\% max HR, respectively) while correlations with maximum HR (bpm), mean HR (bpm), and mean HR (\%) and sRPE-TL were moderate (0.30 ≤ {\textbar}r{\textbar} \&lt; 0.50). Conclusions: In NCAA Division I women soccer, sRPE-TL is strongly associated with external measures of workload. These relationships were stronger during match play, with acceleration load and total distance exhibiting the strongest relationship with sRPE-TL.},

	abstract = {The primary means of disseminating sport and exercise science research is currently through journal articles. However, not all studies, especially those with null findings, make it to formal publication. This publication bias towards positive findings may contribute to questionable research practices. Preregistration is a solution to prevent the publication of distorted evidence resulting from this system. This process asks authors to register their hypotheses and methods before data collection on a publicly available repository or by submitting a Registered Report. In the Registered Report format, authors submit a stage 1 manuscript to a participating journal that includes an introduction, methods, and any pilot data indicating the exploratory or confirmatory nature of the study. After a stage 1 peer review, the manuscript can then be offered in-principle acceptance, rejected, or sent back for revisions to improve the quality of the study. If accepted, the project is guaranteed publication, assuming the authors follow the data collection and analysis protocol. After data collection, authors re-submit a stage 2 manuscript that includes the results and discussion, and the study is evaluated on clarity and conformity with the planned analysis. In its final form, Registered Reports appear almost identical to a typical publication, but give readers confidence that the hypotheses and main analyses are less susceptible to bias from questionable research practices. From this perspective, we argue that inclusion of Registered Reports by researchers and journals will improve the transparency, replicability, and trust in sport and exercise science research.

Subjects were grouped by the presence (ACTN3) or absence (ACTN3) of α-actinin-3, as well as by individual genotype (RR, RX, and XX). Among female participants, ACTN3 reported 64.5 seconds faster (p = 0.048) 1-mile PRs compared with their ACTN3 counterparts. No differences were observed when comparing 5K PRs between genotypes. Two one-sided test equivalence testing revealed that none of the effects observed when comparing ACTN3 and ACTN3 were equivalent to zero. Our study confirms a reportedly greater prevalence of XX benefits for endurance performance in females when compared with males but fails to strongly link ACTN3 genotype to endurance performance. Practitioners should continue to be cautious when using genetic information for talent identification and sport selection.},

We tested our model by examining the relationship between inflammatory activity – in vivo and in vitro – and decision-making characterized by impulsivity, present focus, and an inability to delay gratification. Results support our model, revealing that inflammation predicts these outcomes even after controlling for factors that may contribute to a spurious linkage between them. Moreover, subsequent analyses revealed that our model was a better fit for the data than alternative models using present-focused decision-making and its health-harming behavioural sequelae (e.g., smoking, risky sexual behaviour) to predict inflammation, lending support for the proposed directionality of this relationship. Together, these results suggest that inflammation may contribute to decision-making patterns that can result in undesirable personal and societal outcomes.},

	abstract = {High-sugar intake may cause endothelial dysfunction. It is unknown if a bout of aerobic exercise improves endothelial dysfunction caused by a high-sugar meal in postmenopausal women. This study evaluated if prior aerobic exercise attenuates postprandial endothelial dysfunction in postmenopausal women. Twenty-two postmenopausal women (age [mean±SD]: 60.4±6.5 years; \% body fat: 40.3\%±7.5\%) underwent an exercise (EX) or no exercise (NE) condition, in a random order, 13-16 hours prior to the high-sugar meal consumption. The EX condition included a 60 min bout of supervised aerobic exercise at 75\% of age-predicted maximum heart rate. The high-sugar meal, consumed after a 12-hour fast, contained 33\% of the subjects' daily energy needs, and 75.6\% energy from carbohydrates. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and blood concentrations of glucose, insulin, endothelin-1 (ET-1), and nitric oxide (NO) were assessed at baseline and 60 min, 120 min, and 180 min postprandially. Repeated measures analysis test showed that there were no condition by time interaction or condition effects for FMD, glucose, insulin, or NO. There was a significant condition by time interaction but no condition effect for ET-1. Area under the curve was also not different by condition for insulin sensitivity or the above variables. In conclusion, prior aerobic exercise compared with NE did not affect FMD, blood glucose, insulin, ET-1 or NO concentrations, or insulin sensitivity following a high-sugar meal in postmenopausal women. Future studies should look at the effect of different EX intensities on meal-induced endothelial dysfunction in this population. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02919488.},

Eight strength-trained men performed 36 back squats using 75\% 1 repetition maximum and 420 seconds of total rest during basic cluster sets of 4 (CS4), rest redistribution sets of 4 (RR4), and rest redistribution sets of 1 (RR1). Rating of perceived exertion (RPE), blood lactate (La), mean velocity maintenance (MVM), and mean velocity loss (MVL) were measured during exercise. Total testosterone (TT), growth hormone (GH), cortisol (C), and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) were measured before exercise and 15, 30, and 60 minutes postexercise. There were no differences between protocols for MVM. However, MVL was less during RR1 compared with RR4 (p = 0.032), and neither protocol was different than CS4. All protocols resulted in similar increases in RPE and La, which remained elevated up to 30 minutes postexercise (p ≤ 0.05). In all protocols, GH increased and returned to baseline by 60 minutes postexercise (p ≤ 0.05). At 60 minutes postexercise, TT was less than all other time points (p ≤ 0.05). There were no main effects for time for SHBG or C. The data from this study show that different types of cluster set protocols can result in proanabolic physiological responses to resistance training. In addition, coaches can redistribute rest periods without affecting perceived effort or metabolic and hormonal changes if the external load, number of repetitions, and total rest time are equalized.},

A secondary purpose was to determine differences between starters and nonstarters. Fasting blood samples were obtained from 19 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I (n = 19; 20 ± 1 years) football athletes over the course of a season beginning before the start of summer off-season conditioning (T1), before (T2) and after preseason (T3) football camp, with remaining samples taken throughout the competitive season (T4-T8). A magnitude-based inference approach was used to define outcomes. Testosterone was higher in starters before the start of the season (T1, Effect Size [ES] = 0.8) and during preconference (T4; ES = 0.7). Postcamp (T3) testosterone was lower in all players, though greater in starters (starters, 0.0\%/0.3\%/99.7\%; nonstarters, 0.2\%/2.9\%/96.9\%). An increase cortisol relative to baseline (T1) was observed in starters early in season (T4, ES = 0.7; T5, ES = 0.5). Creatine kinase was elevated at all time points in all athletes, with starters having higher circulating levels throughout season. These data demonstrate that changes in hormonal markers may be experienced over a season of football and differ by playing status. Differences between starters and nonstarters may be indicative of greater damage and stress experienced by starters, which may result from a greater number of repetitions.},

	abstract = {This study compared the acute cytokine response, and kinetic and kinematic profile following back squat exercise in resistance-trained men. In a randomized, cross-over design, 10 resistance-trained men (27±4 y, 1.80±0.07 m, 82.8±6.7 kg, 16.3±3.5\% fat) performed the back squat exercise using traditional and cluster set configurations. Kinetic and kinematic data were sampled throughout each condition. Venous blood was sampled prior, immediately post, 30 min, 60 min, 24 h, and 48 h post-exercise for plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-15 (IL-15). Cluster sets allowed for greater mean power (mean difference, 110 W; 90\% confidence interval, ±63 W; benefit odds, 41 447:1), driven by higher overall mean velocities (0.053 m∙s-1; 0.039 m∙s-1; 3 105:1) as evidenced by the lack of clear contrasts for mean force. IL-15 increased post-exercise in both conditions, but increased at 24 h (0.13 pg·mL-1; ±0.11 pg·mL-1; 486:1) and 48 h (0.12 pg·mL-1; ±0.10 pg·mL-1; 667:1) in traditional sets only. IL-6 increased similarly in both conditions, post-exercise through 60 min post. Cluster set configurations allow for greater mean power, attributed to higher velocities. Despite a similar response of IL-6, traditional set configuration may provide a greater stimulus for hypertrophy as evidenced by a secondary increase in IL-15.},

	abstract = {Curcumin, a turmeric extract, may protect against cardiovascular diseases by enhancing endothelial function. In this randomized controlled double-blind parallel prospective study, fifty-nine healthy adults were assigned to placebo, 50 mg (50 mg), or 200 mg (200 mg) curcumin, for 8 weeks. The higher curcumin (200 mg) supplementation produced a dose-mediated improvement in endothelial function measured by flow-mediated dilation (FMD). The outcome was a clinically substantial 3.0\% increase (90\% CI 0.7 to 5.3\%, p = 0.032; benefit : harm odds ratio 546 : 1) with the 200 mg dose, relative to placebo. The 50 mg dose also increased FMD relative to placebo by 1.7\% (-0.6 to 4.0\%, p = 0.23; 25 : 1), but the outcome was not clinically decisive. In apparently healthy adults, 8 weeks of 200 mg oral curcumin supplementation resulted in a clinically meaningful improvement in endothelial function as measured by FMD. Oral curcumin supplementation may present a simple lifestyle strategy for decreasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases. This trial was registered at ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN90184217).},

Twenty-four participants (RT = 12, 25 ± 1 year, 179.1 ± 2.2 cm, 84.6 ± 2.1 kg; UT = 12, 25 ± 1 year, 180.1 ± 1.8 cm, 85.4 ± 3.8 kg) performed TRD (4 × 10, 120-second rest) and CLU (4 × (2 × 5) 30 seconds between clusters; 90 seconds between sets) with 70\% one repetition maximum, randomly. Kinematics and kinetics were sampled through force plate and linear position transducers. Resistance-trained produced greater overall force, velocity, and power; however, similar patterns were observed in all variables when comparing conditions. Cluster sets produced significantly greater force in isolated repetitions in sets 1-3, while consistently producing greater force due to a required reduction in load during set 4 resulting in greater total volume load (CLU, 3302.4 ± 102.7 kg; TRD, 3274.8 ± 102.8 kg). Velocity loss was lessened in CLU resulting in significantly higher velocities in sets 2 through 4. Furthermore, higher velocities were produced by CLU during later repetitions of each set. Cluster sets produced greater power output for an increasing number of repetitions in each set (set 1, 5 repetitions; sets 2 and 3, 6 repetitions; set 4, 8 repetitions), and the difference between conditions increased over subsequent sets. Time under tension increased over each set and was greater in TRD. This study demonstrates greater power output is driven by greater velocity when back squatting during CLU; therefore, velocity may be a useful measure by which to assess power.},

	abstract = {Non-invasive temperature monitoring with a sensor inside protective headgear may be effective in detecting temperatures that are associated with heat illness. The purpose was to establish the relationship between in-hardhat temperatures (Tih) and core temperature (Tc) as measured by rectal (Tre) and esophageal (Tes) probes. Thirty males (age 24.57 ± 4.32 yrs.) completed two trials: continuous submaximal exercise (CSE) and a series of high intensity 30-s sprints (HIE) with a one-minute rest between each. Exercise in both conditions was in a 36(°)C environment (40\% RH) while wearing a standard hardhat with sensors mounted on the forehead that were monitored remotely. Exercise continued until voluntary termination or until Tc reached 39.5(°)C. Temperatures, heart rate, cardiorespiratory, and perceptual responses were monitored throughout. A physiological strain index (PSI) was calculated from Tc and HR. The final temperatures in the CSE condition were 38.77 ± 0.41, 38.90 ± 0.49 and 39.29 ± 0.58(°)C and in the HIE condition, final temperatures were 38.76 ± 0.37, 38.91 ± 0.47, and 39.19 ± 0.57 f (o)C for Tih, Tre, and Tes, respectively. The PSI in CSE was 9.62 ± 062, 9.18 ± 1.11, and 10.04 ± 1.05, and in the HIE condition 9.67 ± 068, 9.29 ± 0.99. and 9.86 ± 1.02 based on Tih, Tre and Tes, respectively. The general agreement between the Tih and other temperature measures along with the consistency as indicated by a low coefficient of variation (approx. 1\%) in the recordings of the Tih sensors at the point of termination suggest that this device, or similar devices, may have application as a warning system for impending heat-related problems.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: In traditional sets (TRD) repetitions are performed continuously, whereas cluster sets (CLU) allow a brief rest between groups of repetitions. We investigated the acute mechanical, metabolic, and hormonal response to CLU in men.
METHODS: Twelve resistance-trained (RT) and 11 untrained (UT) men performed TRD (4 × 10 repetitions with 2 min rest) and CLU [4 × (2 × 5) with 1.5 min rest between sets 30 s rest between clusters] at 70 \% 1RM back squat in random order. Seven days separated trials. Average power and time under tension (TUT) were calculated. Blood was sampled pre, sets 1, 2, and 3; immediate post-exercise, 5, 15, 30, 60 min post-exercise for blood lactate, total testosterone (TT), free testosterone (FT), growth hormone (GH), and cortisol.
RESULTS: CLU produced greater average power at an increasing number of repetitions over each set with greater total volume load. TUT was shorter for RT and lower for CLU in repetitions 1, 6, 7, 8. Blood lactate was higher Set 2 through 30 min in TRD. RT had higher TT; however, the time course was similar between RT and UT. TT and FT increased immediate post-exercise and remained elevated 30 min in both conditions. GH was significantly greater during TRD with a similar pattern observed in both conditions. Cortisol was significantly lower at 30 min in CLU.
CONCLUSION: CLU allowed greater total volume load, shorter TUT, greater average power, similar anabolic hormonal response, and less metabolic stress. The acute response was similar despite training status.},
